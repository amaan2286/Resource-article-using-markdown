# **Gaganyaan: India’s Human Space Mission**

## **Overview**
Gaganyaan is India’s first human spaceflight mission, spearheaded by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). This project is a significant step forward for India, aiming to send a three-member crew into Low Earth Orbit (LEO) at an altitude of 400 km for three days before safely returning to Earth.

## **Key Components of Gaganyaan**

### **Human-Rated LVM3 (HLVM3) Rocket**
- The HLVM3 is an upgraded version of ISRO’s LVM3 heavy-lift launcher.
- It uses three stages: solid, liquid, and cryogenic.
- It features a **Crew Escape System (CES)** to ensure astronauts' safety in case of an emergency during launch or ascent.

### **Orbital Module (OM)**
The OM has two parts:
1. **Crew Module (CM):**
   - Provides a safe, Earth-like environment for astronauts.
   - Features a double-walled structure with thermal protection, life support systems, and avionics.
   - Designed for re-entry and safe splashdown in the sea.
2. **Service Module (SM):**
   - Supports the CM in orbit with propulsion, power, thermal systems, and communication equipment.

## **Training and Crew**
Four Indian Air Force (IAF) officers, selected for the mission, are undergoing rigorous training:
1. **Group Captain Prasanth Balakrishnan Nair** – Fighter pilot with 3,000 flying hours.
2. **Group Captain Ajit Krishnan** – Test pilot with extensive experience.
3. **Group Captain Angad Pratap** – Flying instructor with a broad range of expertise.
4. **Wing Commander Shubhanshu Shukla** – Combat leader and test pilot with 2,000 flying hours.

## **Mission Preparations**
To ensure the safety and success of the mission, ISRO is conducting several preparatory steps:
1. **Unmanned Test Flights:** 
   - These tests will validate key technologies, including the Crew Escape System and Orbital Module systems.
   - The first test flight, Gaganyaan-1, is scheduled for late 2024.
2. **Humanoid Robot (Vyommitra):**
   - A robot will simulate human presence during one of the test flights.
3. **Facility Development:**
   - Dedicated astronaut training centers and mission control facilities have been established.
